<title>I made a sourdough starter two weeks ago</title>
<h1> 🐄 </h1>
</head>
<p style="font-family:Arial;">My breath is warm and quiet and dry when I put my hand under my nose when I drink from my waterbottle<br>
Feel like a small friendly cow to myself<br>
Need to be put on a feeding schedule.<br>
I drew myself thick eyelashes around my round cow eyes<br>
put on a green jumper<br>
Emerged into the world's paddock to reenter a barn, take off my jumper, sit in my Indonesian class.<br>
Mata sapi, cow's eye, sunny side up egg<br>
I made myself one on white rice<br>
And the carton got empty.<br>
I miss the smell of animals kept for profit<br>
That buys school fees and new gates<br>
Of hay on my dad's work shirt.<br>
I miss the life that was available to me<br>
That my mum didn't let me have<br>
Didn't want me too country.<br>
Now I'm in the city and I'm the only cow<br>
Might get cut open</p>
