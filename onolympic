<h1> Aku ingin </h1>

<p style="font-family:Arial;">I wish I was<br>
riding through the cane<br>
In the pouring rain<br>
On Olympic<br>
To her door<br>/<br>
My romantic notions<br>
Make me pathetic at best<br>
And a liar at worst<br>
I act as if I have a little country community<br>
But all I have<br>
Are kids that were bullies in highschool and their mining rich dads<br>
And I'm not quite poor enough for it to be cute</p>
