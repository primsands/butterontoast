<h1> Beach </h1>
</head>
<p style="font-family:Arial;">My beach has never been introduced to science but I think if it was it would go like:
<br> "Who are you, what are you doing<br>
I am undefinable, I exist for myself
<br>you should not know the names of me
<br>leave them unnamed
<br>I am here for a walk, a swim, fly a kite, kick a ball, sit on the rocks and make a living room out of the uncomfortable bits
<br>drag a net, find an irukandji, rush all the nippers out of the water
<br> but do not call me names
<br> I have a gully in the middle, which is sometimes full and sometimes not
<br> I have mangroves out the back and salt flats next to them
<br> I have an ugly bleaching scummy reef in the middle that you can walk out on
<br> I have bindis in the sand and I laugh when you get them in your grey little feet
<br> I have paths to other parts of me, carved in by BMX bikes
<br> I have tides and lows but do not measure them
<br> I have rocks on either side but do not analyse them
<br> Put me in your mouth and swallow and sunburn and trudge home
<br> Do not try to name me, you'll ruin it"</p>
