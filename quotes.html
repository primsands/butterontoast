  "It is also well to be reminded that the arts are not merely a bourgeois invention and the possession of a particular class, but are a fundamental part of human life anywhere, without which our lives would not be human, and not a superficial froth that is separable from the 'hard' realities of life, as revealed to us by science and economics, which is a prejudice peculiar to the last century and this."<br>
  <br>"A confused terminology has underlain the ambivalence of Australian attitude towards Asia. Australians have regarded their European background as a historical fact and the location of their continent as a geographical accident. This terminology should be reversed. The European content of Australia's population is a historical accident; its position on the map, an unalterable geographical fact."
  <br><br>"After Obama's 2010 Nobel Peace Prize:<br>
<em>A Nobel prize for thinking of peace?<br>
  Come on, my mum thinks about it every night!"</em>
  <br><br>
  "In a survey conducted by the National Center for Social and Criminological Research in Egypt, and its results published by the daily al-Masry al-Youm, just a week before the beginning of the uprising, the sample of 2,956 people expressed that achieving justice and political stability, lowering prices, having access to clean drinking water, and providing comfortable transportation topped the list of changes they desired for their country."

  "Human beings probably could have done more easily without kings than they could have done without cabbages. Yet the history of kings has never been neglected or ignored in any culture. The history of cabbage has been woefully neglected in all. So, too, has the history of most other foods. In fact, history seems to be a record of what has happened between mealtimes."

  "After learning in December 2004 that Australia had announced the establishment of a 1000-mile maritime exclusion zone to deal with asylum seekers, without consulting Jakarta, the Indonesian foreign minister, Wirajuda, remarked wearily to the Australian defence minister, Hill: 'You are blessed with a country that is rich in ideas and initiatives. Unfortunately, we seem to be on the receiving end of most of them.'"

  "Why the flag's got to be put away at night I have no idea. The country still exists at night, right? And plenty of people are hard at work. Doesn't seem fair those people can't have the same flag flying over them. Maybe it's a silly thing to worry about -- just the kind of thought a person like me is likely to fret over."

  "They came in to the little town
<br>A semi-naked band subdued and silent.
<br>All that remained of their tribe.  
<br>They came here to the place of their old bora ground
<br>Where now the many white men hurry about like ants.
<br>Notice of real estate agent reads: 'Rubbish May Be Tipped Here'.
<br>Now it half covers the traces of the old bora ring.
<br>They sit and are confused, they cannot say their thoughts:
<br>'We are as strangers here now, but the white tribe are the strangers.
<br>We belong here, we are of the old ways.
<br>We are the old sacred ceremonies, the laws of the elders.
<br>We are the wonder tales of Dream Time, the tribal legends told.
<br>We are the past, the hunts and the laughing games, the wandering camp fires.
<br>We are the lightning bolt over Gaphembah Hill
<br>Quick and terrible, 
<br>And the Thunder after him, that loud fellow.
<br>We are the quiet daybreak paling the dark lagoon.
<br>We are the shadow-ghosts creeping back as the camp fires burn low.
<br>We are nature and the past, all the old ways
<br>Gone now and scattered. 
<br>The scrubs are gone, the emu and the kangaroo are gone from this place.
<br>The bora ring is gone.
<br>The corroboree is gone.
<br>And we are going.'"
